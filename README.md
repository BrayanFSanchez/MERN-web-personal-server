# Project Name

Welcome to the server of my MERN project.

2. Navigate to the server directory: cd server
3. Install the dependencies using Yarn: yarn install

## Configuration

1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the server.
2. Define the required environment variables, such as the database connection string or other project-specific configurations.

yarn start

The server will run on http://localhost:3977/ by default.
